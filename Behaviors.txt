BEHAVIORS

Start dragging:
- Make sure it's on an empty space
- Show starting dot

Drag onto an available space:
- If the queue is only one long:
  - Set previous space's belt ghost to face this position
  - Move dot to this position
- If the queue is multiple long:
  - Check length of queue, and check to see if the current underneathy can reach that far
  - If it can, place the ending underneathy and clear the queue
  - If it can't, check all available underneathies to see if any can reach
    - If one can, place that at the end and update the one at the beginning
    - If none can, it's invalid

Drag onto an entity:
- If the queue is only one long:
  - Place an underneathy at the beginning
  - Add current tile to the queue
- If it's multiple long:
  - Check the queue. If the direction has changed, it's invalid
  - Add the current tile to the queue
